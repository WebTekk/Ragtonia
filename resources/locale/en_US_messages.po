"Ragnaron the 1st was a verry smart King which made plans because of the "
"oppression from Orion to end the war against Orion for ever. The problem "
"was, that Orion would exterminate them completely if they would lose. "
"Ragnaron decided to hurt Orion just that much, that Ragtonia would have "
"enough time to build a bigger army. So he've made this war strategie:"

"In this night, the King himselve encouraged his folks with the words:\n"
"\n"
"\"Sons and daughters Ragtonias, my brothers and sisters!\n"
"I see the same fear in your eys which dispaired me, too.\n"
"The day might come when the bravery of the humans expires because of we "
"betray our camerads and all friendships will break.\n"
"But this day is still far!\n"
"The hour of wolves and smashing shields, when the era of the humans goes "
"down roaring.\n"
"But this day is still far!\n"
"Tomorow we will fight!\n"
"For everything you love, on the earth, I'll tell you, withstand humans of "
"Ragtonia!\"\n"
"\n"

"Early in the next morning, Ragnaron the 1st rode alone on his horse Epona. "
"On their way they saw a emissary who told them, that all other troops were "
"ready. Arrived on the canyon, the king stopped and looked down to the camp "
"and as soon as the first sunbeams climbed the trees, he rushed down the "
"canyon to the enemy troops. When the soldiers of Orion saw, that the king "
"himselve was fighting, they attacked, too. They hoped, to hurt and defeate "
"Ragtonia with the death of their king. Ragnaron threw his lance to a cliff "
"and with its burst, the other troops Ragtonia's knowed, that they have to "
"attack. They attacked from every site. The troops of Orion where verry "
"suprised. The battle went three days and three nights. There were fancy "
"platoons on both sites. When some men of Orion began to roll heavy, burning "
"barrels at the men of Ragtonia, Ragnaron jumped of Epona to stop one of the "
"barrels from crushing a whole group of his soldiers. It rolled over him and "
"slowed down until it finally stopped. But Ragnaron the 1st was so weakened "
"that he had to carry himself on the back of Epona to not fall down. Then "
"came the leader of Orion and challenged him. After a heavy fight, Ragnaron "
"defeated him and finally took him captive. But the leader pushed his sword "
"into Ragnaron's chest. Then he was immediately killed by angry men. But "
"Ragnaron still died on the battlefield. He was buried in Helms Klamm, his "
"fortress. A legend claims that Epona still lived and was accompanied by "
"Ragnaron's spirit, but that is only a legend."
